## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The site was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](add the github link to the website).
2. Navigate to the "Settings" of the repository, located at the top of the page in the menu.
3. On the left-hand side is a menu and click on the "Pages" from the Code and Automation section.
4. Under "Branch" click on the dropdown menu called "None" and select "Main".
5. On the dropdown menu next to "Main" select "Root" and click the "Save" button.
6. Navigate to the "Code" of the repository, located at the top of the page in the menu.
7. On the right-hand side is an "About" section and below that is the "Deployments" which shows the GitHub pages that deployed.
8.

The live link can be found [here](add the live link to the website).

The site is hosted using GitHub pages and is deployed via the main branch. The deployed site uses a Version Control System to track changes in the source code using the Gitpod terminal to commit messages and push them to GitHub. This will update the repository automatically when GitHub receives these commits in the main branch. The main landing page of the site must be named index.html for the site to be deployed correctly, as the search engines are looking for this document to load the site onto the web.

### Cloning

To run the site locally, you can clone the repository into the code editor of your choice. As the code will be linked to my repository, any pushes you make from your repository will come to me for approval. This was not implemented using Gitpod but from my local computer using VS Code via Git to GitHub.

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](add the github link to the website.git).
2. Click on the green code button above the list of files for the drop-down menu.
3. Select the preferred cloning method of HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click on the copy button of the web URL to your clipboard.
4. Open Git Bash or Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory (using cd).
6. In your IDE Terminal, type 'git clone' and paste the copied URL from your clipboard add the github link to the website.git e.g. https://github.com/Diane-4P/harry-potter-quiz.git.
7. When you press Enter your local clone has been created.
8. To then stop using the repository and cut ties with it you type 'git remote rm origin' into the terminal.

### Forking

When you fork a GitHub repository you will make a copy of it, which can be put into your own account, and you can make changes without affecting the original repository.

1. Log into GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository you want to fork.
2. At the top of the repository to the right, under the menu, there is a "Fork" button.
3. You should have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account.
