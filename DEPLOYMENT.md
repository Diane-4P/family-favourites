## Deployment Procedure

****

### How to Clone the Repository

To run the site locally, you can clone the repository into the code editor of your choice. As the code will be linked to my repository, any pushes you make from your repository will come to me for approval. This was not implemented using Gitpod but from my local computer using VS Code via Git to GitHub.

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](add the github link to the website.git).
2. Click on the green code button above the list of files for the drop-down menu.
3. Select the preferred cloning method of HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click on the copy button of the web URL to your clipboard.
4. Open Git Bash or Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory (using cd).
6. In your IDE Terminal, type `git clone` and paste the copied URL from your clipboard add the github link to the website.git.
7. When you press Enter your local clone has been created.
8. Set up a virtual environment.
9. Install the packages from the requirements.txt file. In the terminal type:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

10. To then stop using the repository and cut ties with it you type in the terminal:

```bash
git remote rm origin
```

### How to Fork the Repository

When you fork a GitHub repository you will make a copy of it, which can be put into your own account, and you can make changes without affecting the original repository.

1. Log into GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository you want to fork.
2. At the top of the repository to the right, under the menu, there is a "Fork" button.
3. You should have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account.
